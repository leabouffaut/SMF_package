# SMF Package

The SMF package is a package includes all code in Matlab for the use and application of the passive stochastic matched filter to the detection of Antarctic blue whale (ABW) calls.

The method is fully described in:
L. Bouffaut, R. Dreo, V. Labat, A. Boudraa and G. Barruol 'Passive stochastic matched filter for antarctic blue whale call detection,' in J. Acoust. Soc. Am, 144(2) (2018).

and any use of this material should refer accordingly. Part of the SMF code was initially written by Gregory Julien, PhD. Julien, G. (2012). 'Filtrage Stochastique et amélioration des performances des systèmes de positionnement d'engins sous-marins en milieu bruyant' (Doctoral dissertation, Toulon).

# This package contains:
1. Main Matlab programs (<i>Offline_savefilterbank</i>, <i>Offline_save_Zcall</i>, <i>Online_application</i>)
1. The same programs but as Matlab notebooks (Matlab Live editor) and their pdf in the <i>Matlab_live</i> folder
1. A function folder (<i>Functions</i>)
1.  folder of saved matrices (<i>Offline_saved</i>)
1. A 24h recording with ABW calls ((<i>RR44_2013_D151.wav</i>).

# Data
A small toy dataset with ABW calls at various SNR is provided (<i>RR44_2013_D151.wav</i>). It consists of a 24h record from the Ocean Bottom Seismomter RR44 deployed during the [RHUM-RUM](http://www.rhum-rum.net/en/) experiment, in the western Indian Ocean.
