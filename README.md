SMF Package

The SMF package is a package includes all code in Matlab for the use and application of the passive stochastic matched filter to the detection of Antarctic blue whale calls.
The method is fully described in:
 L. Bouffaut, R. Dreo, V. Labat, A. Boudraa and G. Barruol 'Passive stochastic matched filter for antarctic blue whale call detection,' in J. Acoust. Soc. Am, 144(2) (2018).

and any use of this material should refer accordingly. 
Part of the SMF code was initially written by Gregory Julien, PhD.
